# neural-network-challenge-1
Week 18 Challenge

## Summary

This application analyzes student loan data and creates a model to predict loan repayment. The neural network package utilized was TensorFlow with Keras.

## Approach

The approach consisted of:

1) Read the csv file to ingest the data and preprocess.
2) Create X and y datasets.
3) Create training and testing datasets.
4) Scale the training data.
5) Create a neural network model.
6) Compile and fit the model.
7) Evaluate the model using test data.
8) Save and export the model.
9) Reload the model.
10)Make predictions.
